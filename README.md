# Scrabble solver

This is program, written in Rust, can find the highest-scoring moves playable for a Scrabble configuration. It was written using "The World's Fastest Scrabble Program", a paper published in May 1988 by Andrew W. APPEL and Guy J. JACOBSON.

## Usage

Next, to run the code, open the folder in which you cloned the directory with `cd scrabble-solver` and finally, run `cargo run`.

## Limitations

This is a very fast program but also a very buggy one. The cli is not very user-friendly and the scoring algorithm isn't perfect.
